# Ralph Loop: substratia.io

**GOAL**: $1000/month profit from Substratia Cloud subscriptions.
**CURRENT**: -$204/month burn, $0 revenue.

## Methodology
Use progressive Socratic self-questioning:
1. "What is the most important thing to do RIGHT NOW for revenue?"
2. "What evidence do I have? What assumptions am I making?"
3. "What's the fastest path to paying customers?"
4. "Am I stuck? If so, pivot."

## This Repo's Focus
substratia.io is the **marketing site + cloud dashboard**:
- Landing pages drive signups
- Dashboard manages API keys and shows synced data
- Stripe checkout converts visitors to customers
- Convex backend handles cloud sync

## Priority Tasks
1. Stripe configuration (env vars, webhook)
2. Conversion optimization (pricing page, CTAs)
3. SEO and content marketing
4. User onboarding flow

## Success Criteria
Output `<promise>REVENUE GENERATING</promise>` when:
- Stripe checkout works end-to-end
- At least one paying customer exists
- Cloud sync verified working for customers

Keep todo list updated. Complete tasks fully. Adapt as needed.
