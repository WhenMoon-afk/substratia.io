### r/ClaudeAI - Helpful Post (Not Promotional)

**Title:** How I handle context loss in Claude Code

**Body:**
```
After months of daily Claude Code use, here's what I've learned about managing context:

**The Problem**
- Context fills up mid-session
- Auto-compaction loses important details
- New sessions = re-explaining everything

**What Works for Me**

1. **CLAUDE.md is your anchor**
Keep it under 3000 tokens. Include: project overview, key directories, coding standards, and a "Do NOT" section. This survives compaction.

2. **Periodic checkpoints**
Before context gets full, ask Claude to summarize:
- Files modified
- Decisions made
- What's pending
Save to CLAUDE.md under ## Session Notes

3. **Strategic /clear**
Sometimes a fresh start beats fighting context drift. But save state first.

4. **Be explicit in prompts**
"Fix the null pointer in handleSubmit at line 42" > "Fix that bug we talked about"

I wrote a longer guide on this: https://substratia.io/blog/context-management-guide

What techniques work for you?

### r/ClaudeAI - Tool Announcement

**Title:** Made a free Claude Code cheat sheet - commands, shortcuts, CLAUDE.md patterns

**Body:**
```
I kept forgetting slash commands and keyboard shortcuts, so I made a reference sheet:

https://substratia.io/tools/cheat-sheet

Covers:
- All slash commands (/clear, /compact, /cost, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C to interrupt, etc.)
- CLAUDE.md template patterns
- MCP configuration examples
- Pro tips for power users

It's free, has a print/save-as-PDF button, and has copy buttons for each section.

I use it basically every day now. Figured others might find it useful.

### r/ClaudeAI - Discussion Starter

**Title:** What's your CLAUDE.md setup look like?

**Body:**
```
Curious how others structure their CLAUDE.md files.

Mine has:
- Project overview (2-3 sentences)
- Key directories
- Coding standards
- A "Do NOT" section (surprisingly important)
- Recent session notes

The "Do NOT" section was a game-changer for me. Things like:
- Do not add comments to unchanged code
- Do not refactor code not related to the task
- Do not commit without running tests

What sections do you include? Any patterns that work well?

### Thread: Context Management Tips

```
🧵 Claude Code context management tips (thread)

I've been using Claude Code daily for months. Here's what actually works for managing context:

1/7
```

```
1. CLAUDE.md is your anchor

Keep it under 3000 tokens. Include:
- Project overview
- Key directories
- Coding standards
- A "Do NOT" section

This survives compaction and starts every session right.

2/7
```

```
2. Checkpoint before context fills

When you see context getting full, ask Claude to summarize:
- Files modified
- Decisions made
- What's pending

Save to CLAUDE.md. Future you will thank you.

3/7
```

```
3. The "Do NOT" section is underrated

Things I include:
- Don't add comments to unchanged code
- Don't refactor unrelated code
- Don't commit without tests

Prevents so many headaches.

4/7
```

```
4. Be explicit, not implicit

Bad: "Fix that bug we discussed"
Good: "Fix the null pointer in handleSubmit at line 42 of UserForm.tsx"

Don't assume Claude remembers. Include context.

5/7
```

```
5. Strategic /clear

Sometimes a fresh start beats fighting context drift.

But: Save your session state first. Ask Claude to write a handoff doc before clearing.

6/7
```

```
6. Free resources

I made a cheat sheet with all the commands, shortcuts, and patterns:
substratia.io/tools/cheat-sheet

And a full guide:

### Show HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: Free Claude Code cheat sheet and context management guide

**Body:**
```
I've been using Claude Code (Anthropic's CLI coding assistant) daily for months. The biggest pain point is context management - sessions fill up, compaction loses details, new sessions mean re-explaining everything.

So I built two free resources:

1. Cheat Sheet (https://substratia.io/tools/cheat-sheet)
Quick reference for slash commands, keyboard shortcuts, CLAUDE.md patterns, and MCP configuration.

2. Context Management Guide (https://substratia.io/blog/context-management-guide)
Deep dive on how context windows work, why compaction loses information, and techniques that actually help.

Both are free, no signup required. The cheat sheet has a print/PDF button.

Happy to answer questions about Claude Code workflows.

## Cloud Sync Waitlist Announcement Posts

### r/ClaudeAI - Cloud Announcement

**Title:** Building cloud sync for Claude Code memory tools - looking for beta testers

**Body:**
```
I built momentum and memory-mcp (free Claude Code plugins for context recovery and persistent memory), and I'm working on cloud sync.

**The problem I'm solving:**
- You use Claude Code on your laptop, desktop, and work machine
- Each device has separate memory databases
- Switching devices = losing accumulated context

**What cloud sync will do:**
- Automatic daily backups of your memory database
- Cross-device sync (laptop ↔ desktop ↔ work)
- Web dashboard to search/browse memories from any browser
- Your local tools stay free - cloud is optional

**Planned pricing:** $9/mo (early access gets a discount)

If you're interested in beta testing, you can join the waitlist:
https://substratia.io/cloud

Full announcement with feature details: https://substratia.io/blog/announcing-substratia-cloud

The free tools (momentum + memory-mcp) work great standalone. Cloud is for people who want the convenience of sync across devices.

What features would be most valuable to you?

## Memory Plugin Posts (Product Focus)

### r/ClaudeAI - Memory Demo Announcement

**Title:** Built a free memory system for Claude - try the interactive demo

**Body:**
```
Claude Code doesn't remember anything between sessions. Every new conversation starts from scratch.

I built memory-mcp to fix this. It gives Claude persistent memory that survives across sessions:
- Stores decisions, patterns, preferences
- Recalls relevant context automatically
- Full-text search across all memories

**Try it without installing anything:**
https://substratia.io/tools/memory-demo

The demo simulates the memory system so you can see how it works. Three scenarios:
1. Quick Start - basic store/recall
2. Decisions - save a technical choice and why
3. Learning - capture insights that persist

If you like it, the actual plugin is free:
`/plugin install memory-mcp@substratia-marketplace`

GitHub: https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/claude-memory-mcp

What do you forget most between Claude sessions?
```

### r/ClaudeAI - Problem/Solution Post

**Title:** How I stopped re-explaining everything to Claude every session

**Body:**
```
The most frustrating thing about Claude Code: it doesn't remember anything.

Every new session:
- "We're using Bun, not npm"
- "The auth is in src/lib/auth.ts"
- "Don't add comments to unchanged code"

**My solution:** I built a memory plugin.

When Claude makes a decision or learns something important, it stores it:
`memory_store "Use Bun for this project - faster than npm, matches lockfile"`

Next session, it can recall:
`memory_recall "package manager preference"`

The memories persist forever. Claude can search them with FTS5 full-text search. No embeddings, no API calls, just fast local SQLite.

**Free to try:**
- Interactive demo: https://substratia.io/tools/memory-demo
- Install: `/plugin install memory-mcp@substratia-marketplace`

Optional cloud sync if you use multiple devices ($9/mo).

What patterns do you wish Claude would remember?

### Hacker News - Show HN

**Title:** Show HN: Memory system for Claude Code - persistent context across sessions

**Body:**
```
I built memory-mcp, a free plugin that gives Claude Code persistent memory.

Problem: Claude forgets everything between sessions. You re-explain your project setup, coding preferences, and decisions constantly.

Solution: A local SQLite database with FTS5 full-text search that Claude can store to and recall from.

Demo (no install): https://substratia.io/tools/memory-demo

How it works:
1. Claude stores important context: "Use Bun for this project, not npm"
2. Next session, it can recall: "What package manager for this project?"
3. Memories persist forever, searchable instantly

Technical details:
- Pure SQLite (better-sqlite3), no embeddings or vector DB
- FTS5 for fast full-text search
- Token-aware loading (fits context window)
- Local-first, your data stays on your machine
- Optional cloud sync for multi-device ($9/mo)

The plugin is MIT licensed: https://github.com/WhenMoon-afk/claude-memory-mcp

Install in Claude Code: /plugin install memory-mcp@substratia-marketplace

Looking for feedback on what memories would be most valuable to store automatically.
